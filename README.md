# Imaginary Products for Imaginary People

Have you ever wanted a mug that stirs your coffee for you? How about an inflatable toilet? If any of that sounds appealing, this repo is for you.

## Welcome, traveler, to the world of strange, fascinating imaginary products!

This repo houses all the goodness of the web app located at [https://imaginaryproducts.vercel.app/](https://imaginaryproducts.vercel.app/).

## Stack

This project is built on Next.js as the base (I cloned the starter, don't judge me), with Tailwind CSS and some Typescript on top. The beating heart of this project is an API setup that makes calls out to OpenAI's API.

## Instructions for Development

First, you'll need an OpenAI API key. One can be obtained for free -- so you have no excuse not to!

Then, of course, run

```js
npm install
```

in the main folder. Then, once everything's installed, and you've got your API key in your brand-new .env file, you can go ahead and run

```js
npm run dev
```

in the main folder. That should get you a working version of the site -- albeit much slower than the production version. (The API calls take twice as long locally, for whatever reason.)
